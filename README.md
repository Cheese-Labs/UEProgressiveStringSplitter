# Progressive String Splitter for ChatGPT

Progressive String Splitter for ChatGPT is an Unreal Engine Code Plugin. It made it easy for us to embed ChatGPT or similar Generative AI services into our applications. By splitting the progressive strings returned from ChatGPT, you can start subsequent processes earlier, which dramatically reduces the response time.
